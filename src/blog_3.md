Why are Type Guards necessary in TypeScript?
Type guards are helpful in TypeScript to assist in runtime type safety of your code. They help you make sure you're working with the right kind of data by letting you narrow a variable's type. It helps prevent runtime errors. Without type guards, TypeScript may not be able to get the type of a value that you're operating on and might lead to some potential bugs or unexpected behavior.

Kinds of Type Guards
typeof Type Guard: This sort of type guard checks against the primitive types, for example, string or number. It enables checking the kind of a variable and narrowing it down.

instanceof Type Guard: It is used for checking if something is an instance of a certain class or constructor. This helps narrow down the type of an object, especially when working with instances of classes.

Type Guards: These are functions that return a boolean and allow the developer to define your own logic to determine a value's type. This proves helpful when you have to deal with intricate types.

Discriminated Unions: Discriminated unions use a common property in order to differentiate various types of unions. It is a strong way of dealing with different types of data and picking out the right type.

Why Use Type Guards?
Error Avoidance: Type guards ensure that the data you are dealing with is of the right type, which cuts down errors in your code.
 Cleaner Code: Type guards provide clarity for a section of code and make obvious your intent.
 Stronger Type Safety: Type guards narrow the type for a variable, providing better type inference, and autocompletion from your editor.
Conclusion
Type guards are an important feature of TypeScript that gives detailed control of the types of data popping up in your codebase through type safety, bug prevention, and readability. They are useful for the protection against such complex data types and will be highly essential in building more robust and maintainable code.
